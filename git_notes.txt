pull requests are how you get commits in github

GitHub is a hub of ./gits directories

you can push and pull commites to and from .git/ directories

you can also clone .git/ directories to new computers or new paths



Master branch is a label that git creates for us when we initialize a repository

HEAD is another label that git creates for us when we create our first commit

HEAD is not a branch

# creates a new branch (label) called git-notes
git branch git-notes
